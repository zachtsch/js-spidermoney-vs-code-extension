# javascript--spidermonkey--run-button README

This is a simple extension that adds a play/run button to the top right of the editor window. When you click the button, the current file is run in the terminal using the `js` command. This is useful for running JavaScript files in the terminal using the SpiderMonkey JavaScript engine.

## Requirements
This extension requires the SpiderMonkey JavaScript engine to be installed on your system and on the path. 
Maybe someday I'll add a feature that downloads and install it, but for now it just assumes it's on the path.
